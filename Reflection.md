# Reflection on Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, ideally several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. CI aims to improve software quality and reduce the time taken to deliver new software updates.

**Benefits of CI:**

- **Early Detection of Errors:** By integrating regularly, errors can be detected early, making them easier to fix.

- **Reduced Integration Problems:** Frequent integration reduces the complexity of merging code changes.

- **Improved Collaboration:** CI encourages collaborative development, as code is shared and integrated continuously.

- **Faster Delivery:** Automated builds and tests speed up the development process, allowing for quicker releases.
